# Poppin Soda Frontend Overview
Welcome to the Poppin Soda website! I made this website for my senior project.  I started learning React on my own and decided to apply what I learned to this website.  My goal for this project was to create a mock website for a business.  I figured that a project like this would help me apply what I learned with stores, hooks, Http Requests, etc.  Along with using React, I also used a few libraries that helped build the project.  I also created my backend service for the site.  You can view the source code and API docs for it in a link down below.

# Development Environment 

The environment I used for this project was Visual Studio Code by Microsoft.  The Web Page was deployed on GitHub.  This project used Node JS, Express JS, and JavaScript.  I also  used Swagger to create my API documentation.  I deployed my backend on Render and my database on MongoDB. These services worked well for this project.  Feel free to check out their websites to learn more.
